"Donations to support the openSUSE project are always welcomed. In fact, Open "

"available to the project’s community through a generous donation of servers "
"by AMD. It is this type of donations that allows people and projects to "
"thrive, develop, innovate and progress. The project is not asking for money, "
"but donations of hardware to use the open-source community’s expertise to "
"empower Linux development, provide openSUSE tools to the free, open source "
